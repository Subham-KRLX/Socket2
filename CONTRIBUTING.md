Thank you for taking an interest in this project.

This is a small demo repository. If you'd like to contribute small fixes or improvements:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a feature branch from main.
- Keep changes small and focused (one idea per PR).
- Add tests for new behavior where applicable.

Pull requests will be reviewed and merged when they are clear and safe.

Thanks!
